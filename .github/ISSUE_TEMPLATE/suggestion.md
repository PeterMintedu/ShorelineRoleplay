My suggestion is that when we get punched like 5 times we get knocked out instead of dying. The knock out should last like 2-3 minutes or you will need someone to pick you up.
Also when you get hit by a gun in the head you should get knocked out too (Not by a bullet).

Is your suggestion related to a current issue?
[if yes then elaborate if no leave blank *delete line to answer*]

**Other info**
It should be a sysytem when you get knocked out you just flop. There could be a system where anyone can CPR knocked out people and it can cost like 200 or something but it would be better as more roleplay would get involved.
Thank you for your time!
